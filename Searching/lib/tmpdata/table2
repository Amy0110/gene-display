The normal sequence, with the base that is inserted in brackets, is AGTA{T}ATAT. The insertion causes a frameshift, which changes an Asparagine to an Isoleucine at codon 455 in exon 10, and creates a premature stop codon at position 3 of the new reading frame. Although this mutation has not, to our knowledge, been reported in the literature, it is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function through either protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. We consider BRCA1 c.1363_1364insT, also known as c.1482insT using alternate nomenclature, to be pathogenic and is indicative of Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC), an autosomal dominant condition that predisposes to early onset breast cancer, ovarian and fallopian tube cancer, as well as other cancers. Breast and ovarian cancer are the predominant BRCA1-related cancers that unaffected female mutation carriers are at risk to develop. The lifetime risk for breast cancer is estimated to be 57 to 84% and the lifetime risk for ovarian cancer is estimated to be 24 to 54% (Antoniou 2003, Chen 2007, Ford 1998). BRCA1 mutations have also been reported in women with fallopian tube carcinoma, primary peritoneal carcinoma, and uterine serous carcinoma (Levine 2003, Pennington 2013). Graeser et al. (2009) found that women who harbor pathogenic BRCA1 or 2 mutations have an increased risk for contralateral breast cancer that is dependent on age at initial diagnosis. It is estimated that the risk to develop a second breast cancer within 10 years of the first diagnosis if initially diagnosed less than 40 years of age is 21 to 31%, between the ages of 40 and 50 is 11 to 13% and after the age of 50 is 8%. Additionally, it is estimated that the risk to develop a second breast cancer within 25 years of their first diagnosis if initially diagnosed less than 40 years of age is 63%, between the ages of 40 and 50 is 44 to 49% and after the age of 50 is 20%. Other cancer risks associated with a BRCA1 pathogenic variant include approximately a 20% risk for prostate cancer in male carriers (Thompson 2002), a 4% risk for male breast cancer (Liede 2004), and an estimated 1 to 3% risk for pancreatic cancer in both men and women (Brose 2002, Thompson 2002). The variant is found in BRCA panel(s).
